    <!--description of my reason creating the website-->
    <strong><section class="autxt"> I've created a website for the school’s cafe and will be assessed based off two standards (91880 and 91884) which in total is worth 10 credits. The school’s cafe needs a way for students, teachers and customers to order their beverages online. This is where I will be constructing a website suitable for this purpose. 
    The website needs to be usable for any person on my website, they can access every page and is able to order their beverage.
